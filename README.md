Hello friends, below I present the sources of the videos of the people who helped me to make this little utility, it helps a client to upload some picture and send trough a form.
I also used more information from other sites, but losted some locations. I hope it can be useful to new students who need to use npm Sharp.
I Thank to all the developers for striving to have freely accessible sources of information for the technological development of mankind 👨🏽💻.
